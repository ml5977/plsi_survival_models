# plsi_survival_models
We provide R code for partial-linear single-index (PLSI) models for survival outcomes with possible time-varying covariates:
- PLSI Cox model for external covariates
- PLSI joint model for internal covariate
- PLSI transforamtion model 

PLSI model is a family of semiparametric models that reside between completely unstructured nonparametric models and restrictive parametric regression models. This method can not only reduce the dimensionality of multiple covaraites to a single index but can also flexibly characterize the joint effect with a nonparametric link function. Our method can be applied to identify important covariates and characterize their joint effect for survival outcomes.
