Partial-linear single-index Cox model for possibly time-varying covariates.
This method can be conducted for both time-independent and time-dependent covariates. 
For time-dependent covariates, we use Surv(start, last, status).
For time-independent covariates, we use Surv(time, status).

Our iterative estimating procedure is developed using 'survival' and 'splines2' R packages.

We have two example data (i.e., simulated data).
Example 1. True link function is linear (i.e., ordinary Cox regression)
Example 2. True link function is nonlinear (i.e., log curved model: g(t)=log(1+t^2))

Our simulation settings are same in the below paper:
